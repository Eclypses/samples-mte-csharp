# MTE Demo API

## Introduction
This is the server API that the MTE console applications run against. The calls are duplicated in the https://dev-jumpstart-csharp.eclypses.com. This API should be run locally against the other console examples. 


## Getting Started
Both sides of the test must use the same version of the MTE. It does require the user to add their MTE libraries to the code for it to work correctly. 

 - The MTE library should be put in the MteSwitchingTest directory

This sample currently works with MTE 3.0.x. To use a different version of the MTE please do the following:

  - Delete all files in the include directory.
  - Copy files from the "/src/cs" directory in the MTE archive to the include directory.
  - Copy the corresponding MTE library into the MteSwitchingTest directory.
